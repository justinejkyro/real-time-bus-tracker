# Real-Time Bus Tracker

In this exercise I created a real-time bus tracker. I used the MBTA, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, bus data to determine stops between the Harvard campus and the MIT campus. Then, I added an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes. A button, "Show stops between MIT and Harvard", once clicked will trigger a function, move(), that will move a marker from one bus stop to the next. This exercise brought together my knowledge of maps, timers, and animation to track real, live data on a map.
